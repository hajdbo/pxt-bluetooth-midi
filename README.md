# bluetooth-midi [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/pxt-bluetooth-midi.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/pxt-bluetooth-midi)

A [Bluetooth low energy MIDI](https://www.midi.org/specifications/item/bluetooth-le-midi) 
support for the @boardname@.
**iOS only currently**.

### ~hint

For another device like a smartphone to use any of the Bluetooth "services" which the @boardname@ has, it must first be [paired with the @boardname@](/reference/bluetooth/bluetooth-pairing). Once paired, the other device may connect to the @boardname@ and exchange data relating to many of the @boardname@'s features.

### ~

## Usage

This package allows the @boardname@ to act as a MIDI peripherical, like a piano. It requires to connect to a BLE MIDI device to receive the commands and play them.

Place a ``||bluetooth start midi service||`` block in your program to enable MDI over Bluetooth low energy.

```blocks
bluetooth.startMidiService();
```

This library uses the [MIDI package](/pkg/microsoft/pxt-midi). 
Please refer to that project documentation for further details.
